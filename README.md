# Smart Attendance System Overview  
A face recognition-based attendance system designed for automated, contactless, and secure tracking. Built using HAAR Cascade and Caffe Model, it integrates deep learning (CNN) and SVM for high accuracy. The system ensures real-time processing, scalability, and improved security over traditional methods.
